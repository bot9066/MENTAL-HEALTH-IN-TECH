# 🧠 Mental Health in the Tech Industry – An Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project explores a 2014 dataset on **mental health in the tech industry**, analyzing the attitudes, perceptions, and challenges employees face regarding mental health in the workplace. The aim is to bring visibility to the **mental health crisis in professional settings**, particularly within tech, where high pressure, long hours, and cultural stigma often go unaddressed.

Through structured data analysis and compelling visualizations, this project uncovers hidden insights about the mental wellness landscape at the time — and connects it to **current-day realities**. It highlights how this decade-old dataset still mirrors issues persisting today.

## 🕰️ Status of the Issue: 2014 vs. Now

In 2014:
- Mental health was **rarely discussed** openly in tech workplaces.
- Many employees were **unaware of mental health benefits**, or unsure if they existed.
- A **strong stigma** existed against seeking treatment or discussing issues with supervisors.
- New or migrant employees experienced higher pressure and isolation.
- A significant number of professionals were afraid of **career repercussions** if they disclosed mental health challenges.

**Since 2014**, some progress has been made:
- **Mental health conversations have increased**, especially post-COVID.
- Remote work has created **new layers of psychological isolation**, while reducing office-based stress.
- **Corporate wellness programs** have become more common — but often lack depth, follow-up, or anonymity.
- Suicide cases, resignations, and workplace burnout have **increased**, showing surface-level awareness has not yet translated into **structural change**.

Many professionals, overwhelmed by lack of support and understanding, **leave their jobs** or **turn to startups** for greater autonomy, mental balance, and purpose.
